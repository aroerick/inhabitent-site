Another hipster camping website. YOLO am I right?

## Tech

It's wordpress. Looping through wordpress to get realtime blog posts and whatnot. PHP is the main source of interaction with wordpress, and is the language that drives the main functionality of the site. 

Sass dominates the majority of the coding somehow (53.4% according to Github). Nesting, mixins, variables all add greatly to the power of base CSS.

And for good measure toss in a little bit of javascript to make the search bar snazzy.

## The Learnz

The loop! There was a lot of learning associated with this project. The Wordpress hierarchy is awesome for targeting specific pages through PHP files. PHP in general and the power it has through wordpress functionality to target specific pieces of posts and pages. I had never touched wordpress before this project so pretty much everything we did with it (themes, plugins, custom posts, taxonomies, pages, etc. etc. etc.).

The extensive use of sass in this project was a huge eye opener for its extensive capabilities. It really makes writing styles so much more streamlined than standard CSS. As I got further into the project I came to realize how powerful it can be if you consider things like variables, mixins, and partials from the very beginning of a project. These are something I plan to incorporate far more thoroughly in the future.
